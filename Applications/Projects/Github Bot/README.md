# GitHub-Follow-Bot

A bot done with python to follow users in GitHub.


## How to use:

- Fill your GitHub `username` and `password` in the space provided
- Fill the person's GitHub `username` whose followers following you want to follow(That might be a little confusing). Basically, select a person(for example, take yourself), you will have some followers, for each of your follower, this bot will follow whoever they are following.
- Then run the python file (It need selenium to run, so `pip install selenium`).


## Why I did this?

Somewhere, I read:
- One in ten people you follow will follow you back.
- One in hundred people you follow will star your repos.
- One in thousand people you follow will fork your repos.

Might be true, might be not ü§∑‚Äç.
